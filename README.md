This application is a "helper application" that makes it easier to keep track of expiring certificates.
You can set up a task schedule to run daily and have the application send an email if a certificate is expiring.

Here is the output from teh "help":
CertificateChecker.exe -h
---> DEBUG: StoreLocation='LocalMachine', StoreName='My', ExpireWithin='', ExpiredOnly='False', EmailNotify='False', DeleteThumbprint='', Filter='' <---
